Project: SOC – Incident Analysis and Response Center

Description: An intelligent monitoring and automated maintenance system designed for Data Center infrastructure. This project focuses on eliminating downtime by using an AI engine that acts as a real-time system administrator.

Key Features:

Logical Hardware Mapping: The system organizes hardware components using a precise numbering logic (PC 1, PC 2, etc.), enabling the exact location of any physical failure.

AI-Driven Defect Detection: An integrated AI constantly monitors the health of each board and system, identifying hardware anomalies and errors instantly.

Automated Incident Response: Upon detecting a fault, the AI triggers an immediate response, rerouting processes from the defective module to healthy systems to ensure 100% uptime.
